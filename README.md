# ngraph.toedgelist

Save ngraph.graph into edge list

# usage

``` js
// let's say your graph has three edges:
var graph = require('ngraph.graph')();
graph.addLink(1, 2);
graph.addLink(1, 3);
graph.addLink(2, 4);

var toEdgeList = require('ngraph.toedgelist');
var edgeList = toEdgesList(graph);
```

Now `edgeList` is equal to `[ [ 1, 2 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 2, 4 ] ]`.

You can also save edge list as string:

``` js
var str = toEdgesList.asString(graph);
```

The `str` variable is now equal to:

```
# generated by ngraph.toedgeslist
# Nodes: 4
# Edges: 3
# FromId	ToId
1	2
1	3
2	4
```
