# ngraph.toedgelist [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anvaka/ngraph.toedgelist.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/anvaka/ngraph.toedgelist)

Save [ngraph.graph](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.graph) into edge list.

# usage

``` js
// let's say your graph has three edges:
var graph = require('ngraph.graph')();
graph.addLink(1, 2);
graph.addLink(1, 3);
graph.addLink(2, 4);

var toEdgeList = require('ngraph.toedgelist');
var edgeList = toEdgeList(graph);
```

Now `edgeList` is equal to `[ [ 1, 2 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 2, 4 ] ]`.

You can also save edge list as string:

``` js
var str = toEdgeList.asString(graph);
```

The `str` variable is now equal to:

```
# generated by ngraph.toedgelist
# Nodes: 4
# Edges: 3
# FromId	ToId
1	2
1	3
2	4
```


# install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm install ngraph.toedgelist
```
